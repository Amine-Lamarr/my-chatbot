[Website Info]
Hey, I’m Amine from Morocco, and I created this website to detect Moroccan money, including both bills and coins. I trained an AI model for object detection called YOLO, specifically the YOLOv8m version, which is capable of recognizing objects in images with high accuracy. 
⚠️ Note: This model currently can’t recognize (1dh, 0.5dh, 2dh, 20dh) but Insh’Allah I will improve it in the future to support them.

[Dataset Info]
I collected and created my own dataset using photos I took with my phone, covering five categories: 5dh, 10dh, 50dh, 100dh, and 200dh. I uploaded the dataset to Roboflow, making it completely public so anyone can access and use it for learning or experimentation.

[How Website Works]
The concept behind this website is simple yet practical: you upload an image containing Moroccan money from the categories I mentioned, and the AI model will automatically detect each bill or coin in the picture, identify its value, and calculate the total amount for you. For example, if you upload a picture containing a 100dh and a 50dh bill, the model will detect both and display the total sum immediately.
